r/neopets Food Club Better
==========================

Description
-----------

A userscript to turn tables on reddit into bets on Food Club.

This userscript allows you to quickly fill out Food Club bets posted by other users on reddit.

Installation
------------

1. As this is a userscript, it requires [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), (Firefox), or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) (Chrome). I've only tested the script in Chrome.
2. View the raw .user.js script file below (or [click here](https://github.com/hooksfordays/food-club-better/raw/master/food-club-better.user.js))
3. Click 'Install'

Usage
-----

1. Visit the daily Food Club Bets thread, always an announcement at the top of [r/neopets](https://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/).
2. Find a table, such as the one pictured below, containing bets that you want to place.
